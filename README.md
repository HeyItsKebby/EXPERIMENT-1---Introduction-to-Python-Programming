# EXPERIMENT-1---Introduction-to-Python-Programming
Python script/code for the given problems: ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM, EMOTICON PROBLEM, UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM.

Instructions:
Write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter
notebook in the dedicated submission bin.

ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM: 
Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters
